# About the Site -- GekeDijkhuis.nl

The website showcases Geke Dijkhuis's artistic work --- primarily in
**reliëfschilderijen** (relief‑paintings) and **bronzen beelden**
(bronze sculptures). For her paintings she has developed her own
technique: she applies relief into the canvas, then paints it, and
lastly accentuates the relief to create depth and texture.

In addition to painting, she creates expressive bronze sculptures ---
often stylised, sometimes combined with other materials like stainless
steel or glass.

The site is structured so visitors can explore her work under clear
categories: *Reliëfschilderijen*, *Bronzen beelden* and *Monumenten*.

## What Makes Her Work Unique

-   **Unique relief‑painting technique:** combining three‑dimensional
    texture with paint for unexpected visual outcomes.
-   **Expressive bronze sculptures:** often incorporating materials such
    as glass or stainless steel.
-   **Dynamic artistic process:** alternating between painting and
    sculpting for continual inspiration.

The website has the feel of an elegant online gallery, inviting visitors
to appreciate her craftsmanship, style, and materials.
